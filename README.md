# CanYouSolveIt
HackerEarth problem Can you solve it? in Java
https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/arrays/1-d/practice-problems/algorithm/can-you-solve-it/description/

This is the first problem I have attempted in the HackerEarth web site.
This site, like HackerRank and LeetCode (among others) provides software
based problems with different difficulties to help engineers improve 
their knowledge and techniques.

If interested in comments on how I approached the problem and my initial
impression on the site, I invite you to read the following post in my blog:

Keep in mind that the best way to learn is to read and experiment.

Enjoy;
